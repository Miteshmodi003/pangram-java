# Pangram Java

Pangram_CoreJava file is precisely as we talked during the interview that should not allow any duplicates alphabets or numbers in a given string. 

# Pangram_CoreJava.java : 
1. It ensures that the given string does not contain any number AND any duplicate alphabet character.
2. Of course, it will check for distinct 26 alphabets and does not compromise with duplicate values.
3. It does not allow any string having length greater than or less than 26.

#Pangram.java --> Another way of verifying
1. It allows a string using every letter of English alphabet at least once.
2. It allows numbers, duplicates which follows regular Pangram pattern according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram

# Pangram Java

There are two java files as mentioned below, both have their own criteria but Pangram_CoreJava file is precisely as we talked during the interview that should not allow any duplicates alphabets or numbers in a given string. 

# Pangram.java : 
1. It declares a sentence as Pangrams that utilizes every letter of English alphabet at least once.
2. It allows duplicate alphabets and numbers, but verifies if the given string contains those distinct 26 alphabets at least once.
3. Basically, it allows a string which has a length greater than 26, but not less than 26.

# Pangram_CoreJava.java : 
1. It ensures that the given string does not contain any number AND any duplicate alphabet character.
2. Of course, it will check for distinct 26 alphabets and does not compromise with duplicate values.
3. It does not allow any string having length greater than or less than 26.
